    "limits": "Reviewed the Saved models boundary against model_application: GLB and package snapshots are staged on the main thread in a disposable scene and published at the approved cursor, selection is preserved, only package textures are packed and the timeline is unchanged. The full installed suite passed 1,253 tests with 2 Windows-only skips on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 only (exact ZIP SHA-256 06f5e16d233224123993950150a7609945d4eaaeed5aa9581ff460ef7958aec3). On 2026-10-10 fingerprints were refreshed after saved splat import. Statements here about splat refusal, splats not being offered or splat import remaining open describe the package review only and are superseded: SPZ, .splat and PLY units are now prepared on a worker and offered, a PLY without splat data continues through this package snapshot, and the summary gains a splat field, as covered by the saved-splat-import topic of this document. The package snapshot, image guard, claim and rollback claims were rechecked and are unchanged; the review date is unchanged. On 2026-10-10 fingerprints were refreshed after import_snapshot began reading bound OBJ normal, roughness and metallic maps as Non-Color by saved texture role and adding a Normal Map node only when one is missing; the statements here were rechecked and are unchanged, as is the review date. On 2026-10-12 fingerprints were refreshed after rewrite_mtl began adding -bm 1 to a bound normal statement without one, so an imported OBJ normal map has full Strength; the statements here were rechecked and are unchanged, as is the review date. On 2026-10-12 the branch was rebuilt again, on main 4bd0061d, which now holds #369 (remote progress), #402 (saved model import undo), #377 and #379 (the saved image first-frame handoff and its native control), #401 (composer session end), #373 (asset organization reviews), #378 (MCP organization tools) and #380 (Library organization). The replay kept #369's remote projection, status fields, job_status paragraph and test helpers, and the handoff's use_first_frame action, native first-frame descriptor and operator, first_frame status field and video_first_frame purpose, beside this import, and moved #402's two desktop Undo checkpoints from apply_model into import_snapshot, which every saved model format uses; apply_model, now called only by Film shots, records none. The staging, cursor, preserved selection, package texture packing and unchanged timeline statements here were rechecked against #402's change and are unchanged; import_snapshot now also records those checkpoints when the saved-result command asks for history. The unit suite and the full installed suite on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 passed against the rebuilt code; the fingerprints were refreshed and the review date is unchanged. On 2026-10-12 the fingerprints were refreshed again after the splat import branch was rebuilt on this rebuild. It adds splat options, worker preparation and the point builder beside this import; import_splat records the same Undo checkpoints as import_snapshot. The statements here were rechecked and are unchanged.",
