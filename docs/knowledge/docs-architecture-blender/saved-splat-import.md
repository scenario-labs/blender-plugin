    "limits": "Reviewed the Saved models boundary against splat_application: main-thread only through validate_destination, no file reads or importers, new mesh, node group and material without reuse by name, publication through the model group helper and verified rollback. The full installed suite passed 1,271 tests with 2 Windows-only skips on macOS arm64 Blender 5.0.1, 5.1.2 and 5.2.1; Linux and Windows CI runs are not claimed. On 2026-10-10 fingerprints were refreshed after import_snapshot began reading bound OBJ normal, roughness and metallic maps as Non-Color by saved texture role and adding a Normal Map node only when one is missing; the statements here were rechecked and are unchanged, as is the review date. On 2026-10-12 the branch was rebuilt again on the package import branch, itself rebuilt on main 4bd0061d, which now holds #369 (remote progress), #402 (saved model import undo), #377 and #379 (the saved image first-frame handoff and its native control), #401 (composer session end), #373 (asset organization reviews), #378 (MCP organization tools) and #380 (Library organization). The replay kept #369's remote projection, job_status paragraph and test helpers, and the handoff's runtime wrapper, apply_saved_result branch, MCP purpose and native first-frame descriptor and operator, beside this import, and import_splat now records #402's two desktop Undo checkpoints when the saved-result command asks for history. The main-thread, fresh-data, publication and rollback statements here were rechecked and are unchanged. The unit suite and the full installed suite on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 passed against the rebuilt code; the fingerprints were refreshed and the review date is unchanged. On 2026-10-12 review fixes made a PLY verify on the ordinary queue while the local-operation slot is busy, importing only as a mesh, and made the native model import dialog report a ScenarioError reason. This topic's statements were rechecked against that change and are unchanged; the changed fingerprints were refreshed and the review date is unchanged.",
