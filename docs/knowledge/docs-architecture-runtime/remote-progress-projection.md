    "limits": "Reviewed that context maintenance projects the validated remote reading and records the display-only scene lane binding in ModelJobs, that MCP job_status reads the same view projection, and that pump._jobs_changed compares drawn job rows (excluding transient offered actions) and online access and redraws only when they change, in addition to existing event redraws; pump.redraw tags the 3D viewport and Preferences regions. Restarted views stay generic and unbound. Installed tests cover one redraw per projected change and per online access change, and none on idle ticks or for a queued refresh. Installed native tests on macOS arm64 Blender 5.0.1, 5.1.2 and 5.2.1 cover these claims. No desktop interaction, screenshot, other operating system or live provider progress is claimed. Scoped 2026-10-10 check of the Render Video first-frame handoff, not a full re-review: ModelJobs adds the use_first_frame action, its single-use approval, the verify_first_frame command and the session-local first_frame status field; polling, delivery predicates, progress projection, bindings and other actions are unchanged; tools_scenario adds the video_first_frame purpose and description text for it, job_status first_frame and render_form source_result; other contracts are unchanged. The claims above still hold; the review date and base revision are unchanged.",
