Installed-ZIP native tests ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 with the system opener and the animation player process patched; no player was opened and no desktop interaction, screenshot or human listening is claimed. Image decoding, still and clip display, MCP parity and live thumbnails remain open. On 2026-10-12 result_media.py and its native tests changed only the waveform box's draw-time status wrapping (measured with Blender's interface font against the drawn region, or inside Studio the width it requests for its popup) and the no-break spaces of the waveform summary; that diff was re-checked against this topic's claims, which do not describe either, so they stand as reviewed on 2026-10-10. This topic's evidence statements describe its own review; the partial physical desktop passes that UI_STYLE and KNOWN_LIMITATIONS record were not part of it.",
