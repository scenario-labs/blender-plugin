The closing sentences were re-reviewed against the local MCP tools, which accept a review only with the job_context_id issued alongside it, and the native Library, which uses the raw review accessor to update loaded rows from read-back records without another request and takes each collection page on the pump tick that finishes it. Installed-ZIP Blender 5.1.2 tests on macOS arm64 with synthetic worker-thread services cover these paths, including undo and scene switches keeping a review, a write in flight during file load, the MCP context binding, an applied review discarded through the MCP status tool keeping its result, an untaken collection page freeing its slot in a one-slot session, native row updates, including from a page read still running when the read-back arrives, and a Library Apply refused while an agent's change holds the single apply; those services refuse a re-add or more than 49 IDs as one 400 that writes nothing, as the service was observed to behave. The latest installed run was on this branch on main 3acb9625, after its restack onto the parent's rebase over the local Film export owner, which conflicted only in evidence records; the full run passed. The three installed tests for the Library fixes that keep read-back on rows and collections a running read replaces and name an agent's change holding the single apply failed before those fixes. No live collection or tag write was made from this repository, and a desktop pass on an earlier candidate made reads only; the observed already-member 400 and one-transaction add, service name uniqueness, DELETE body survival, tag normalization and live limits remain unverified here. No desktop interaction or release acceptance is claimed. Blender 5.0 and 5.2 were not run for this topic.",
