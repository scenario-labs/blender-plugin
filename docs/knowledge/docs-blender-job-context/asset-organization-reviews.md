Installed-ZIP Blender 5.1.2 tests on macOS arm64 with a synthetic worker-thread service cover these paths, including undo and scene switches keeping a review and a write in flight during file load; that service refuses a re-add or more than 49 IDs as one 400 that writes nothing, as the service was observed to behave, and the latest installed run was on the stacked Library head that contains this branch. No live collection, tag or bulk request was made from this repository; the observed already-member 400 and one-transaction add, service name uniqueness, DELETE body survival, tag normalization and live limits remain unverified here. No native Library or local MCP control, desktop interaction or release acceptance is claimed. Blender 5.0 and 5.2 were not run for this topic.",
