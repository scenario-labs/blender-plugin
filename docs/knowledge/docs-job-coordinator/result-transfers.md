Other API and runtime integration claims retain their prior evidence rather than a fresh claim-by-claim verification; no active UI/MCP adoption or live/paid operation acceptance is claimed. Explicit interrupted-download recovery and cooperative OS locking reviewed against scoped revision checks, receipt verification, process-exit exclusion tests and the JobSession restart test. No active UI/MCP wiring, older-writer compatibility, orphan-file adoption, scene recovery or live storage acceptance is established.",

# docs/JOB_COORDINATOR.md: result transfers

Evidence for [the canonical document](../../JOB_COORDINATOR.md).

Source families separate independent maintenance work. The review date, coverage,
source fingerprints and document-wide limitations were preserved during the split.
Grouping sources does not renew the review or attribute every inherited claim to
this subset. Review and narrow this topic's limits when its evidence changes.
