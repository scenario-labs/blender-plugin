    "limits": "Limitation wording reviewed against the export primitive: session commands exist without native/MCP controls, verification strength depends on ffprobe and Blender builds without H.264/AAC cannot export. The case-study bundle is absent. Builds lacking H.264/AAC encoders are detected only when the render child fails. Re-reviewed after the placeholder pin, free-space and cancellation checks and the distinct-file media budget; the limitation wording is unchanged. Re-reviewed after the inactive-session delivery guard; the limitation wording is unchanged. Re-reviewed after the rebase onto 72723f02, whose merged changes to the session, coordinator, workers and native test registry add Film review controls, upload retirement on deactivation, a restart-upload command, inference-only cancellation and two native test modules; export admission, delivery, retirement, shutdown ordering and thread ownership are unchanged, and the native export module stays registered. The guide's export wording was reconciled with the merged Film review controls: review scenes now have native/MCP controls, while export still has none.",
