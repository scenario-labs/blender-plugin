    "limits": "Reviewed that inspect_result_previews returns envelope levels and still metadata, never an image or player launch, and that background Blender leaves image stills in the decode state until the scheduler's 120-second expiry fails them. Installed-ZIP native tests (tests/blender/test_mcp_result_previews.py) ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.0.1, 5.1.2 and 5.2.1 with a synthetic SDK transport, an offline storage stub and the real offline audio decoder; no live Scenario preview, other operating system, desktop interaction or MCP client session is claimed. Re-checked after the restack onto the roughness caption fix: caption() now reads ROLE_LABEL from core.jobs.result_previews, which labels every role in result_metadata.TEXTURE_ROLES, so inspect_result_previews reports a roughness map as Roughness (N), the same caption as its tile. A new installed test checks that caption and fails on the previous head without the fix; for this restack the native suite ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 only. The other claims are unchanged. Re-checked after the restack onto the number-first tile captions: the parent's tiles keep the role or kind label and the number apart and draw the number first, as (3) Albedo, while Tile.caption keeps Albedo (3) for status lines; here a shared _label helper feeds both tile_targets and caption(), so inspect_result_previews still reports the caption status lines and saved-job controls use, such as Roughness (N), with the tile's number. For this restack the native suite ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.0.1, 5.1.2 and 5.2.1. The other claims are unchanged. Re-checked after the restack onto the measured status wrapping: the parent's draw now wraps status, error and Retry lines by the width Blender's interface font measures and joins a caption's words with a no-break space in those drawn lines; Tile.caption, tile_targets and caption() are unchanged, so inspect_result_previews still reports captions such as Roughness (N) with ordinary spaces, reading as the drawn line does. For this restack the native suite ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 only. The other claims are unchanged. Re-checked on 2026-10-12 after the rebase onto main at 4bd0061d, not a full re-review: since the previous review main changed tools_scenario.py (three Film review and four asset organization tools, and other tools' workflow cost, Film composition, first-frame handoff, reference upload, inference-only cancellation, saved original, history row kind and cloud history changes); none of these changes touch inspect_result_previews, its specification or the scheduler wait it uses, so the claims above still hold and these sources' fingerprints are the rebased files'; the review date and base revision are unchanged.",
