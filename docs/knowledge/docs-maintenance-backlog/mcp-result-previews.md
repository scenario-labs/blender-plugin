Installed-ZIP native tests (tests/blender/test_mcp_result_previews.py) ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.0.1, 5.1.2 and 5.2.1 with a synthetic SDK transport, an offline storage stub and the real offline audio decoder; no live Scenario preview, other operating system, desktop interaction or MCP client session is claimed. Re-checked after the restack onto the roughness caption fix: the installed test file gained a roughness caption test, and for this restack the native suite ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 only. The other claims are unchanged.",
