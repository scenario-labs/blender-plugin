    "limits": "Reviewed where Play copies are written (cache/media-playback), their read-only private storage, the reuse budget, removal on a connection change, file load or extension disable unless a running animation player reads them, the day-old sweep and the animation player environment without SCENARIO_, PYTHON or proxy variables. The system player is opened through Blender's wm.path_open, whose bundled Blender 5.1.2 implementation calls os.startfile on Windows and xdg-open on Linux with Blender's own environment, so only the animation player's environment is filtered; that inheritance is read from the operator source, not observed in a launched player. What the operating system's default player records is outside this review. Installed-ZIP native tests ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 with the system opener and the animation player process patched; no player was opened and no desktop interaction, screenshot or human listening is claimed. On 2026-10-12 result_media.py and its native tests changed only the waveform box's draw-time status wrapping (measured with Blender's interface font against the drawn region, or inside Studio the width it requests for its popup) and the no-break spaces of the waveform summary; that diff was re-checked against this topic's claims, which do not describe either, so they stand as reviewed on 2026-10-10. This topic's evidence statements describe its own review; the partial physical desktop passes that UI_STYLE and KNOWN_LIMITATIONS record were not part of it.",
