    "limits": "Reviewed only the service inventory row, the adapter coverage sentence and the closing paragraph of the asset organization section: the shared organization commands call the adapter methods through the coordinator, its workers and the JobSession review owner, with a guard before each write and a get_bulk read-back, and after AlreadyMembers send only the assets read back as not yet members, within three add requests per review; the local MCP organization tools and the native Library controls prepare, apply and inspect those reviews and make no direct SDK call. No SDK method, raw exception or dependency changed. No live collection or tag write was made from this repository, and a desktop pass on an earlier candidate made reads only; the observed already-member 400 and one-transaction add, service name uniqueness, DELETE body survival, tag normalization and live limits remain unverified here. No desktop interaction or release acceptance is claimed. Rechecked after the Library view started drawing the review card under the organized asset's row, left the controls that start a read enabled while it runs, named a connection without collections in the Organize dialog and kept a settled card's outcome shown after another caller's prepare evicts its review: the view still prepares, applies and discards only through the shared owner, sends nothing new and draws read-only, so these claims are unchanged.",
