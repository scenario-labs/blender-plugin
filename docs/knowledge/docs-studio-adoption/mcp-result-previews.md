    "limits": "Reviewed that local MCP inspect_result_previews reads the same scheduler states, still metadata and envelopes as the native preview tiles and Waveform control; the compact composer surface and live and desktop acceptance remain unclaimed. Installed-ZIP native tests (tests/blender/test_mcp_result_previews.py) ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.0.1, 5.1.2 and 5.2.1 with a synthetic SDK transport, an offline storage stub and the real offline audio decoder; no live Scenario preview, other operating system, desktop interaction or MCP client session is claimed. Re-checked after the restack onto the roughness caption fix: caption() now reads ROLE_LABEL from core.jobs.result_previews, which labels every role in result_metadata.TEXTURE_ROLES, so inspect_result_previews reports a roughness map as Roughness (N), the same caption as its tile. A new installed test checks that caption and fails on the previous head without the fix; for this restack the native suite ran on macOS arm64 Blender 5.1.2 only. The other claims are unchanged.",
