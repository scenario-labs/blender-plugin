Scoped 2026-10-10 check of the Render Video first-frame handoff, not a full re-review: ModelJobs adds the use_first_frame action, its single-use approval, the verify_first_frame command and the session-local first_frame status field; polling, delivery predicates, progress projection, bindings and other actions are unchanged; tools_scenario adds the video_first_frame purpose and description text for it, job_status first_frame and render_form source_result; other contracts are unchanged. The claims above still hold; the review date and base revision are unchanged. Scoped 2026-10-10 check of the native first-frame control, not a full re-review: ModelJobs.poll also writes first_frame_assets, the eligible still asset IDs, into each saved view's meta for the native descriptor; status words, progress, delivery, offline lines and redraws are unchanged. The claims above still hold; the review date and base revision are unchanged.",
