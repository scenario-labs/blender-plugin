Studio previews.py and preview_worker.py adoption, automatic result previews, the compact composer surface and live or desktop acceptance are not implemented by this change. Scoped 2026-10-12 check of the Render Video first-frame handoff, not a full re-review: ModelJobs adds the use_first_frame action, its single-use approval, the verify_first_frame command and the session-local first_frame status field; polling, delivery predicates, progress projection, bindings and other actions are unchanged; tools_scenario adds the video_first_frame purpose and description text for it, job_status first_frame, render_form source_result and first_frame_route, and refusal of described exclusive file inputs in raw generate bodies; other contracts are unchanged. The claims above still hold; the review date and base revision are unchanged. Scoped 2026-10-12 check of the native first-frame control, not a full re-review: ModelJobs.poll also writes first_frame_assets, the eligible still asset IDs, into each saved view's meta for the native descriptor; status words, progress, delivery, offline lines and redraws are unchanged. The claims above still hold; the review date and base revision are unchanged. On 2026-10-12 the model_jobs.py and tools_scenario.py fingerprints were refreshed after the saved model package import was rebuilt on this topic's sources. It adds import-unit projection, status fields, per-format import controls and package journeys beside the unchanged progress projection: view.meta import_units is set before _project_remote, and status adds import_units, import_findings and model_import beside lane and the remote fields. These claims were rechecked and the review date is unchanged. On 2026-10-12 the model_jobs.py and tools_scenario.py fingerprints were refreshed again after saved splat import was stacked on the package import. It adds splat approval options, worker preparation and import notices to model_jobs.py, with view.meta import_notices set before _project_remote, splat options to the MCP tools, splat labels and notice rows to the descriptors and splat fixtures to the tests. The explicit splat preparation discards a pending automatic application like any explicit import, so the progress projection and delivery predicates are unchanged. These claims were rechecked and the review date is unchanged. On 2026-10-12 review fixes made a PLY verify on the ordinary queue while the local-operation slot is busy, importing only as a mesh, and made the native model import dialog report a ScenarioError reason through the shared _refusal wording. This topic's statements were rechecked against that change and are unchanged; only the fingerprints of the sources that change touched were refreshed, other drift is left as it was, and the review date is unchanged.",
